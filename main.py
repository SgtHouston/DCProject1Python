# Steps taken
# 1. Create game window
# 2. Title, Logo, and Background
# 3. Add Images
# 4. Player Movement by increasing/decreasing pixel coordinate value in every loop
# 5. Attach pixel increase/decrease to keyboard input
# 6. Add boundaries to the board
# 7. Create an enemy
# 8. Movement mechanics of the enemy
# 9. Add a background image
# 10. Create Bullet
