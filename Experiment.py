# Steps taken
# 1. Create game window
# 2. Title, Logo, and Background
# 3. Add Images
# 4. Track image/player movement in infinite loop.  
# 4. Player Movement by increasing/decreasing pixel value in every loop
# 5. Attach pixel increase/decrease to keyboard input
# 6. Add boundaries to the board
# 7. Create an enemy
# 8. Movement mechanics of the enemy
# 9. Add a background image
# 10. Create Bullet
# 11. Bullet_Y boundary reset fire to ready
# 12. Separating Bullet movement from player x movement.
# 13. Collision Detection For Bullet/Enemy
# D = SqRt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
# 14. Creating multiple enemies in a list to iterate through - [i]
# 15. Add text and display score 
# 16. Add sound - background, bullet, collision
# 17. Collision Detection for Enemy/Player-space
# 18. 'Game Over' message
# 19. High Score Board json added
# TODO Difficulty Menu using speeds
# TODO enemy Classes
# D = SqRt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
